## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

I gained a better understanding of centering elements with Flexbox and structuring clean, semantic HTML. Here's a snippet I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued Development
I want to focus on mastering CSS Grid for more complex layouts and explore accessibility best practices to make my projects more inclusive.
